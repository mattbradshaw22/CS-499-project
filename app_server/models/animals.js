/**
 * animals.js

 * Defines the Mongoose schemas and model for rescue animal records.

 * and includes general animal information, training status,
 * reservation status, and acquisition location data.
 *
 * The acquisition location is stored as a nested schema so that
 * city, state, country, latitude, and longitude remain grouped
 * together. The latitude and longitude values will also support
 * future distance-based animal search and ranking functionality.
